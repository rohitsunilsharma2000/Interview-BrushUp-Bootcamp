## Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Factory Method

### Abstract Factory

### Builder

### Prototype

### Singleton

---

## Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Flyweight

### Proxy

---

## Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Chain of Responsibility

### Command

### Iterator

### Mediator

### Memento

### Observer

### State

### Strategy

### Template Method

### Visitor
